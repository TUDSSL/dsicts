Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an expensive and unproven technology that distracts from global decarbonization efforts while allowing the oil and gas industry to conduct business as usual. 

If its efficacy is questionable, its financial rationale is worse. Projects from Algeria to Texas demonstrate the technology’s troubled history of cost overruns and delays. Yet an IEEFA review of 16 projects finds that even though the industry claims a 95% capture rate is achievable, no existing project has consistently captured more than 80% of carbon.

For gas companies, CCS means removing the CO2 contained in the gas field; this is known as Scope One emissions and often represents well under 10% of the total emissions associated with each gas project. It rarely involves the burying of Scope Two emissions, which is the CO2 created when gas is processed at the downstream gas plant, cleaning it up by removing impurities such as CO2 and nitrogen, before it is sold on the domestic market, or chilled to create liquefied natural gas (LNG) for shipping to global export markets.

The majority of GHG emissions from gas projects are created when the gas is combusted or burnt by consumers for heating or cooking, as a feedstock for industry, or generating electricity. None of these emissions, categorized as Scope Three, are captured by CCS facilities, and they represent around 90% of the emissions from a gas project.

To put into perspective the challenge involved, global energy-related CO2 emissions rose by 410 million tonnes (mt) to reach a new high of 37.4 billion tonnes in 2023. Meanwhile, after 50 years of trying, the capacity of CCS dedicated to the geological storage of CO2 was only 11.33 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), and the amount of CO2 injected was below capacity levels.

The Gorgon CCS venture is part of the 15.6mtpa Gorgon LNG project operated by Chevron and located on Barrow Island offshore Western Australia. According to the Global Status of CSS report, published each year by industry group the Global CCS Institute (GCCSI), the Gorgon CCS project only injected 1.72mt of CO2 into storage in the 2022-23 fiscal year to 30 June, or 43% of the targeted annual CO2 injection volume of 4mtpa. Based on the Gorgon experience, it can be concluded that less than 10mtpa of CO2 was injected in 2023 – or 0.00026% of global energy-related emissions last year.
