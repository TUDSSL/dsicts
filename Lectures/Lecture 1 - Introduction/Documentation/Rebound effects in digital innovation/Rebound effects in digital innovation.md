GHG emissions from the ICT sector have been rising year after year, with ICT forming 2.1%-3.9% of total global GHG's in 2020. This contribution will likely further increase with the growing range of ICT applications, accelerating demand for novel ICT (AI, blockchain, IoT, robotics) and the increasing reliance on digital technologies to support the net zero transition in other sectors. The efficiency gains ICT creates in these sectors, as well as its own, are usually viewed as central to reducing emissions worldwide because less energy is required for the same output.

This assumption ignores the behavioral and social responses as well as the adjustments to the wider economic system that typically occur when the efficiency of a process is improved. Efficiency improvements reduce the cost of the relevant good or service, which can encourage an increase in demand. Emissions from the ICT industry over the last 50 years have risen from almost zero to their current level due to growing demand for digital technology despite rapid improvements in efficiency.

Direct rebound effects occur for the same good or service that had originally become more efficient and because the efficiency gains made it cheaper and thus encouraged an increase in demand. Meanwhile, indirect rebound describes a large collection of subtler and more elusive mechanisms, which also lead to an increase in consumption but of a different good or service.

Sustainability and environmental impacts in general, and rebound effects in particular, are largely neglected in the design, development, or innovation processes for ICT. For example, technologists typically lack the knowledge and tools to assess environmental sustainability in software engineering practices. The full emissions life cycle and rebound effects are also overlooked in the greening of technologies such as 5G, with such ‘‘green IT’’ initiatives abstracting away from the social complexities that conflict with technological solutions to environmental problems. In grappling with ICT’s emissions, these processes need to consider ICT’s other contributions to, and impacts on, human prosperity and the environment beyond emissions (e.g., to ecosystems and biodiversity, ICT’s use of natural resources, e-waste, etc.).

The practice of ‘‘responsible innovation’’ offers a useful approach to achieve this, drawing on multiple perspectives to ensure transdisciplinary expertise informs such design and development processes. This particular conceptualization of responsibility, a forward-looking, ‘‘care’’-based approach to the future, highlights the sense of actively reflecting on current developments and seeking to shape them toward societal benefit. Pertinent questions include not only ‘‘what could go wrong?’’ but ‘‘what happens if we succeed?’’ The outcomes of success can be just as challenging in terms of societal impacts as those of failure—for example AirBnB’s progress from a peer-to-peer sharing app to presenting serious challenges to city planners and councils. Note that this goes strongly against Silicon Valley's 'move fast and break things' mentality...

Given that ICT pervades multiple activities and sectors worldwide, the total of all environmental rebound effects (direct and indirect) includes an infinite number of possible mechanisms rippling throughout the global economy and involving complex interactions between every sector. Studies that do attempt to quantify rebound effects introduce boundary constraints for what impacts they do consider, often adding together potential individual rebound effects in order to calculate a rough overall estimate. 

Not only are direct environmental rebound effects difficult to identify, confine, and measure, but workshop participants discussed how they must also be considered in tandem with social and economic dynamics. These could be perceived either positively or negatively, depending on the discipline, leading to inherent tensions between the benefits and drawbacks of different rebound effects. Economic growth that emerges from efficiency gains, and which contributes to increased employment, prosperity, and/or increased well-being, was a core example provided by workshop participants. Most economists thus view economic growth as a positive rebound that emerges from increased efficiency. On the other hand, environmentalists are concerned that such economic growth can (and will) lead to negative environmental impacts, and so the evaluation of efficiency improvements must also consider limits to material production and consumption, environmental degradation, and social inequalities.

What ultimately underpins these challenges is that assessment of ICT requires balancing known impacts—such as economic growth, unemployment, and cost of living—with unquantifiable risks and uncertainties associated with social and environmental impacts. We argue that these difficulties with considering rebound effects are compounded by a current socio-political context that promotes techno-solutionist and efficiency-centric perspectives for how digital technology impacts the economy, societies, and the environment.
