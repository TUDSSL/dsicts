Post-growth refers to societies that do not pursue GDP growth as an objective, and which are able to meet human needs in an equitable way without growth while staying within their fair share of planetary boundaries.

Limits to Growth was the first report to pose the question of whether there are limits related to the Earth system that could put constraints on industrial development. In the Standard Run of its system dynamics model, which assumed the continuation of historical decision-making, the result is overshoot and collapse. Resource depletion leads to the collapse of the industrial base, followed by the collapse of everything that is dependent on it - services, the food supply, and ultimately, the human population. However, critics have noted that these models can run the risk of underestimating unpredictable technological breakthroughs that might be incentivized by higher resource prices.

The actual trends of the world closely track the Double Resources scenario, in which collapse occurs later and is driven not by scarcity of non-renewable resources, but by persistent pollution and its impact on ecosystem stability - a regenerative capacity limit. 

Natural scientists have linked Earth system trends to socioeconomic trends, including economic growth, illustrating the "Great Acceleration" of ecological impacts and population by economic growth. In contrast, some economists have argued that as economies get richer, after a specific point a development, their impact on the environment is likely to decrease. The new consensus in the empirical literature, however, is that although some local pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide, have fallen in high-income countries, typically due to better policy, this does not hold for greenhouse gas emissions, material use, or other global ecological impacts.

Much of the research on reconciling economic growth with planetary boundaries has been framed as a question of whether it is possible to achieve green growth - i.e., to decouple GDP from carbon emissions and material use (the latter because it is strongly linked to environmental pressures and biodiversity loss). This literature distinguishes between relative decoupling, which is a decline in the material or carbon intensity of GDP, where GDP grows faster than material use and emissions; absolute decoupling, which is when GDP grows while material use and emissions decline; and sufficient absolute decoupling or genuine green growth, which is when GDP grows while material use and emissions decline enough to keep the economy within planetary boundaries. 

Cross-national evidence indicates that GDP remains coupled to resource use as measured by material footprint (i.e., accounting for the biomass, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels required to support the final consumption of goods and services). This finding holds across material categories and most regions, with some exceptions, such as decreasing fossil fuel use in some
European countries. The consensus from recent reviews and meta-analyses is that while relative decoupling of GDP from material use is common, there is no evidence of sustained absolute decoupling. Moreover, modelled projections indicate that at the global scale, absolute decoupling is unlikely to occur even with optimistic assumptions about technology.

Cross-border research indicates that as high-income economies grow and shift towards services, they increasingly offshore agricultural and industrial production and rely on imports (e.g., for agriculture, the Global North net-imports embodied land and biomass from the Global South). Domestic material extraction might therefore decline, but total material footprint - which accounts for materials embodied in trade - continues to increase. These explanations are in line with the ecological economics view of the engine of the economy being energy, materials, and human labor.

The rest of this paper is about actual research in the field of post-growth and not particularly relevant to explaining the relationship between economic growth and sustainability.
