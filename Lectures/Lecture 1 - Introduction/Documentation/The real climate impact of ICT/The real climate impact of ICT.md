ICT has a growing ‘‘carbon footprint’’ arising from greenhouse gases (GHG) released from all its life cycle stages. This includes embodied emissions (the GHG emissions released from the extraction of raw materials required, the manufacturing process and transport to the business or user), use or operational emissions (from energy use and maintenance) and end-of-life emissions (disposal).

Given the topic importance, there are surprisingly few studies analyzing the environmental impact of ICT and they are often characterized by a lack of interrogatability, potential for conflict of interest, a limited scope that leaves out growing ICT trends and an underestimation of ICT’s carbon footprint as significant proportions of total emissions are omitted.

##### ICT's current carbon footprint
Historically, ICT emissions have grown continuously alongside global emissions. Several studies prior to 2015 have estimated the carbon footprint of ICT. These show an increase in ICT’s carbon footprint over time, even without considering the full life cycle emissions, with the trend line showing a 40% increase 2002–2012. The growth in ICT’s emissions has coincided with consistent growth in our total global carbon footprint, where global GHGs have grown by 1.8% per year (approximately 20% per decade). This indicates ICT’s footprint has likely grown faster than global emissions, with a very uncertain best estimate of twice as fast.

Across studies, roughly 23% of ICT’s total footprint is from embodied emissions, yet the share of embodied emissions for user devices specifically is ca. 50%. This is because, unlike networks and data centers, user devices are only used for parts of the day and use less electricity, but are exchanged often, especially in the case of smartphones. Electricity consumption of user devices and domestic equipment has decreased over the last 15–20 years driven by legislation and public procurement policy, such as the EU ERP directive and EnergyStar. However, efficiency improvements will not reduce embodied emissions drastically. While production processes are becoming more efficient, the manufacturing footprint of smartphones is increasing because of more advanced integrated circuits, displays, and cameras. 

With a large share of their footprint coming from their manufacture, extending smartphones’ lifetime is the best way to reduce their footprint. Most studies reviewed here assume an average lifetime of 2 years, partly driven by phone contracts that promise users the newest models. Legislation encouraging repair, e.g., the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, can help, alongside business models centering around service rather than product provision or selling repairable products to markets in the Global South.

Studies systematically underestimate the carbon footprint of ICT due to the ‘‘truncation
error.’’ This error arises from the partial exclusion of supply chain pathways by the traditional process of life cycle analysis (LCA). By mapping the LCA’s system boundary onto the EEIO model, an EEIO-based estimate can be made of the truncated supply chain pathways. When truncation error has been adjusted for in this way, the carbon footprint for ICT, including TVs and other consumer electronics, rises to 1.2–2.2 GtCO2e (2.1% – 3.9% of global GHG emissions) in 2020 with ca. 30% coming from embodied emissions and 70% from use phase emissions.

##### ICT's future carbon footprint
There has been a long history of ICT equipment becoming more efficient (and thus cheaper and more productive) with time. Moore’s Law allowed the ICT industry to exponentially increase chips’ performance, speed, and reduce their power consumption. The exponential improvements of processors has kept the exponential growth in demand partly in check in terms of energy consumption.

There is scope for further efficiency improvements in data centers through: improvements in server
virtualization; efficiency gains in servers, storage devices, and data center cooling technology; and the move toward large data centers that are more energy efficient due to efficiencies of scale and the ability to invest in AI to optimize energy use. For efficiency improvements in user devices, there is evidence of carbon savings from TVs: older, more energy-intensive CRT and plasma TVs have been replaced by more efficient LED TVs; and TV sales have dropped due to users now watching video on laptops and smartphones. However, efficiency improvements might be coming to an end. As transistors have shrunk in size and increased in speed, they have begun to heat up; this led to manufacturers putting a speed limit on processing in 2004. The problem now is ‘‘quantum entanglement’’ where transistor layers become so thin that electrons jump between them, making transistors increasingly unreliable. If processor efficiencies are reaching a limit, data centers’ power consumption will likely rise as increasing demand will no longer be counterbalanced by increasing efficiency.

Projections of ICT GHG emissions from 2020.

Malmodin argues that so far, efficiency improvements are continuing, and data center emissions are expected to stay at 1% of global electricity and at the same level of emissions as in 2015 in the next 5 years. This trend has already been bucked by the rapacious growth of AI data centers! Furthermore, Masanet et al. reported that data centers’ operational energy consumption has increased only marginally from194 TWh in 2010 to 205 TWh in 2020 despite global data center compute instances increasing by 550% over the same time period—showing the effectiveness of efficiency improvements in ICT. Masanet et al. also note that these efficiency improvements would be able to offset a doubling of data center demand relative to 2018; beyond that point, energy demand will rise rapidly.

##### Stabilizing emissions due to energy efficiency and saturation
As highlighted above, ICT has seen rapid and continuous efficiency gains. Yet increases in demand for computation and the number of ICT-enabled devices per person have outpaced these energy efficiency improvements, resulting in growth in ICT’s energy consumption and carbon footprint year-on-year. This pattern fits with the rebound effect described by Jevons Paradox whereby an efficiency improvement leads to an even greater proportionate increase in total demand, meaning total resource requirements rise rather than falls, as is often assumed. While Jevons Paradox has not been proved to apply within the ICT industry, it is risky to assume it does not apply given historical evidence of ICT emissions consistently rising despite significant improvements in efficiency.

Within a few years, every person on Earth might have a smartphone and the total number might not further increase. There is some evidence suggesting that the average lifetime of smartphones is increasing too, which will decrease the yearly embodied carbon associated with people replacing their smartphones. In addition, Malmodin argues that there is a limited time per day that people can be using their phones, theoretically capping energy consumption. The same pattern of saturation could be true for other ICT equipment, which could stabilize ICT’s emissions. However, ICT companies generally have a strong incentive to prevent saturation from happening as this would cut their income growth. There is economic pressure for them to create new technologies for individuals and organizations to buy. An example of this is the increase in IoT devices, which require little person time and can operate in the background, driving both embodied and use phase emissions from the production of billions of IoT devices, the networks allowing them to communicate and from data centers that analyze the IoT data. Other important trends, such as the growth in AI, would also escape this natural saturation. The history of ICT does not provide precedents for a saturation effect; it is therefore unlikely to occur without active intervention. Furthermore, there is still scope for more ICT infrastructure growth beyond smartphones before this innovation cycle even begins, e.g., for data centers in the Global South.

Growth in the internet’s infrastructure capacity allows for new data-intensive services and applications; these offer more affordances to users, driving demand for the services and therefore further infrastructure growth. Peak data traffic is one driver for this infrastructure growth due to increased demand for data-intensive services; other influences include ensuring technology is always accessible to all users.

##### Enabling carbon savings in other industries
In their report SMARTer 2030, the Global eSustainability Initiative, which represents ICT companies, claim that ICT could save 9.1 GtCO2e in 2020 and 12.08 GtCO2e in 2030 in other industries, such as health, education, buildings, agriculture, transport, and manufacturing—mostly due to improved efficiency. This would allow a 20% reduction of global CO2e emissions by 2030, holding emissions at 2015 levels and decoupling economic growth from emissions growth. Relative to their estimate of ICTs own emissions of 1.27 GtCO2e in 2020 and 1.25 GtCO2e in 2030, GeSI12 argue that ICT is net carbon negative and that governments and businesses should invest more into ICT. According to them, already in 2015, ICT saved 1.5 times its own emissions. There is also a strong argument that ICT will accelerate the use of renewable energy in the grid and hence lead to decarbonization of the energy supply.

So far, there is little evidence that these predictions have come true. History has shown us that growth in the global economy and its carbon footprint has continuously risen, even with ICT creating efficiencies in other industries. It is risky to assume that further ICT-enabled efficiencies
will suddenly start to create significant carbon savings in the wider economy without governance and intervention. Rather, it is more likely that ICT enables emission increases in other sectors because it enables efficiencies, leading to growth in the very areas into which ICT delivers those efficiency gains—including growth in industries that are already carbon-intensive. ICT only enables efficiencies in other industries if it completely substitutes more traditional carbon-intensive activities rather than being offered in addition to them.
