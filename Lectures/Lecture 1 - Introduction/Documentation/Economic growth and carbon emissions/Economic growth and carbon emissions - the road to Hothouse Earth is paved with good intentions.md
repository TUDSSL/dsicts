Even if global emissions are drastically reduced in line with the 66% goal of COP 21 that would keep us below 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial temperatures, a series of self-reinforcing bio-geophysical feedbacks and tipping cascades could still lock the planet into a cycle of continued warming and a pathway to the final destination "Hothouse Earth". To avoid those risks, humanity will have to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to net zero already by 2050. 

The problem is that, even though scientists argue that the worst-case scenarios are still preventable, because technical solutions to bring about deep decarbonization are available and beginning to work, they happen to go against the economic logic and the corresponding value system that have dominated the world economy for the last half-decade. Attempts to modify this system have met with some success locally, but very little success globally in reducing GHG emissions. Climate stabilization requires a fundamental disruption of hydrocarbon energy, production, and transportation infrastructures, a massive upsetting of vested interests in fossil-fuel energy and industry, and large-scale public investment.

The latest report by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate speaks about a “new era of economic growth” which is sustainable, zero-carbon and inclusive and driven by rapid technological progress, sustainable infrastructure investment and drastically increased energy efficiency and radically reduced carbon intensity. And International Monetary Fund economists Cohen et al., using trend/cycle decomposition techniques, find some evidence of decoupling for the period 1990–2014, particularly in European countries and especially when emissions measures are production-based. The essence of the decoupling thesis is captured well by the title of the OECD report “Investing in Climate, Investing in Growth.” The OECD report, prepared in the context of the German G20 Presidency, argues that the G20 countries can achieve “strong” and “inclusive” economic growth at the same time as reorienting their economies toward development pathways featuring substantially lower GHG emissions.

All economic activity requires energy; to the extent, this energy comes from fossil fuels, the energy use results in emissions of CO2. This linkage implies that deep emissions reduction will constrain economic growth unless there is decoupling—meaning that drastic emission reductions are possible with little or no effect on growth. The Kaya identity is frequently used to analyze global emissions (C) into measurable drivers relevant to climate and energy policy: population (P), per-capita income (Y/P), carbon intensity of primary energy supply (C/E), and energy of GDP (E/Y):
$$
C=P \cdot \frac{Y}{P} \cdot \frac{C}{E} \cdot \frac{E}{Y}
$$
Carbon emissions rise when world population increases when world population and/or per-capita income rises. Emissions decline when carbon intensity of energy declines (e.g. renewables) and when the energy intensity declines (e.g. energy efficiency). Looking individually at each of these drivers shows constant growth of population and per-capita GDP strongly dominating decreasing carbon and energy intensity. The world as a whole has only achieved relative decoupling of growth of emissions and growth of real GDP but no absolute decline in emissions. Additionally and critically, models cannot identify emissions pathways consistent with the 66% emissions reduction goal without a large-scale ramp-up of CCS facilities. 

In a climate-constrained world, which achieves net-zero emissions by 2050 (or at least 85% emissions reduction compared to 1990), the growth rate of global real per-capital income is found to be negative (at least -1.34%). This means that there is a conflict between growing the world economy and keeping global warming from becoming dangerous and unstoppable. Even under the techno-optimistic assumption that we manage to bring about historically unprecedented reductions in carbon intensity and energy intensity, the climate constraint is binding in the sense that future global economic growth would have to be not just lower than historical growth, but even negative. Our plea (my plea too) is that we do whatever it takes to force through the technological, structural, and societal changes needed to reduce carbon emissions so as to stabilize warming at 1.5 degrees and just accept whatever consequences this has in terms of economic growth. 

Based on IPCC guidelines, GHG emissions are counted as the national emissions coming from domestic production. This geographical definition hides the GHG emissions embodied in international trade. Rich countries including the EU-27 and the United States. with high average consumption levels are known to be net carbon importers as the CO2 emissions embodied in their exports are lower than the emissions embodied in their imports. Vice versa, most developing (and industrializing) countries are net carbon exporters. What this implies is that, because of cross-border carbon leakages, CB emissions are higher than PB emissions in the OECD countries but lower in the developing countries. This indicates that while there may well be a Kuznets-like delinking between per-capita income and per-capita PB emissions, it is as yet unclear whether such delinking is also occurring in terms of CB emissions. If not, the notion of “carbon decoupling” has to be rethought—in terms of a delinking between income and CB emissions. After all, it is no great achievement to reduce domestic per capita carbon emissions by outsourcing carbon-intensive activities to other countries and by being a net importer of  GHG, while raising consumption and living standards.

Carbon-Kuznets-Curve. Emissions have not passed the turning point of decoupling.

Our results suggest that economic growth has not decoupled from CB emissions. Some of the OECD countries have managed to some extent to delink their production systems from CO2 emissions by relocating and outsourcing carbon-intensive production activities to the low-income countries. The generally used production-based GHG emissions data ignore the highly fragmented nature of global production chains (and networks) and are unable to reveal the ultimate driver of increasing CO 2 emissions: consumption growth.
