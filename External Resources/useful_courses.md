https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fznzH-gf9h8


The rapid proliferation of AI is increasing focus on the environmental costs associated with large-scale model training and deployment. As cloud-native technologies form the backbone of modern AI systems, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is spearheading efforts to balance AI innovation with sustainability. This session will provide an overview of the CNCF effort to identify key areas, techniques, and best practices for energy-efficient AI in cloud-native environments. Attendees will gain insights into a newly developed taxonomy that categorises remediation patterns and sustainable practices across AI lifecycle phases, deployment environments, and personas.

###  Eco-Tech: Exploring IT's Impact on a Sustainable Future, TUM
https://www.coursera.org/learn/eco-tech-exploring-its-impact-on-a-sustainable-future

Immerse yourself in the world of information technology and discover how it can help shape a sustainable future. 
Combining scientific precision with accessible insight, this course offers a deep dive into the nexus of technology and environmental sustainability. From the basics of climate science to the advanced applications of green computing and artificial intelligence, we explore the wide range of challenges and opportunities that IT offers regards the fight against climate change.
For this exciting exploration, we (TUM and Software Campus) have invited nine experts to share their diverse perspectives. With a rich mix of English-language scientific presentations and German interviews, all content is fully subtitled to break down language barriers and foster a diverse learning experience.

Should efficiency be considered as one of the metrics along with performance in deep learning research? What can we do to offset the large carbon footprint of training neural networks? The research field of Green AI tackles the sustainability aspect of AI and the costs that come with digitalization. There is an increasing need to talk about the environmental, economic, and social costs of AI.

### The Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering, Microsoft
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/sustainable-software-engineering-overview/

Sustainable Software Engineering is an emerging discipline at the intersection of climate science, software, hardware, electricity markets, and data center design. The Principles of Sustainable Software Engineering are a core set of competencies needed to define, build, and run sustainable software applications.

### Sustainable Software Engineering
https://open.hpi.de/courses/sustainablesoftware2022

This two-week free course is about resource-efficient software engineering. We'll discuss how to apply climate-friendly decisions and actions along the life cycle of software development and their context. In the first part of the course, we will address the area of tension between climate and digitization. We will look at how IT causes CO2 emissions and how IT technologies can save CO2 emissions. What are the possibilities in software development to make processes more sustainable? What are the main problems in software development? How can they be solved? While the first part is theory oriented, the second part will be practical and will have specific examples. Therefore, we will give you some detailed insights into programming resource-efficient software.

## Green data management

### Green Sustainable Data Centres
https://www.ou.nl/web/green-sustainable-data-centres/-/cursus-green-sustainable-data-centres

In IT Industry the data centres are the largest consumers of energy. Data centre energy consumption worldwide has doubled since 2000 and by 2020, it is predicted that the Carbon footprint of the EU data centre community will constitute 15-20% of Europe's total CO2 emissions.
The European Code of Conduct on Data Centres gives best practices how the energy efficiency of data centres can be measured and improved. In 2011 a group of scientists became aware that in the curricula of the European Universities students do not learn about sustainable IT. That's why they formed a consortium and in 2013 they obtained funding from e-Infranet for an introductory course. The goal of the consortium is to expand this introductory course to a full master programme.

### The Future of Green Data Centres, British Chamber of Commerce Singapore

Although relatively small and with average temperatures of 30-34°C all year round, the island of Singapore is a highly desirable location for data centres due to its strong economic outlook, stable political and regulatory environment, and reliable infrastructure.
This has resulted in an explosion of data centres across the island with many more planned in the coming years. Leaving Singapore with a major question to answer.
Where will they get the power?
Data centres are well known energy guzzlers with one of the major contributing factors being the massive air-conditioning systems required to combat the large quantities of heat being produced by the IT equipment. Singapore has a well documented history of understanding global trends and predicting the most valuable industries to invest in. This has resulted in huge amounts of land and money being allocated to support what they see as the future with the Petrochemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries being shining examples of where Singapore got it right. The next big bet is data storage and management with the development of digital districts such and Punggol and the proliferation of data centres all over the island.
