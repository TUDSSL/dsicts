## Introduction to sustainability: 


#### How to Save the Amazon: A journalist's deadly quest for answers
Dom Phillips

https://guardianbookshop.com/how-to-save-the-amazon-9781786581839/

As the world becomes more aware of the significance of the Amazon, home to nearly 400 billion trees, working in this vast region has become ever more dangerous for activists and journalists. Fires, land grabs, and the invasion of reserves have all spiked over recent decades, pushing the world's biggest forest ever closer to a point of no return. The last few years have seen efforts to reduce deforestation, but the question remains; can we save this globally essential ecosystem before it is too late? An urgent work of reportage which takes the reader deep inside the Amazon rainforest, and shows that even if you kill a journalist, you cannot silence a story.


#### The Age of Sustainable Development
Jeffrey D. Sachs. Foreword by Ban Ki-moon, Columbia University Press

https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-age-of-sustainable-development/9780231173155/


A a compelling and practical framework for how global citizens can use a holistic way forward to address the seemingly intractable worldwide problems of persistent extreme poverty, environmental degradation, and political-economic injustice: sustainable development. Sachs offers readers, students, activists, environmentalists, and policy makers the tools, metrics, and practical pathways they need to achieve Sustainable Development Goals. 


#### World Without End
Jean-Marc Jancovici, Christophe Blain

https://guardianbookshop.com/world-without-end-9780241661949/

Coming face to face with global warming, the unlikely duo - along with Mother Nature, Pop Eye and Jiminy Cricket, among others - create a picture of what the solution to our predicament actually looks like. Yes, we have a fossil-fuel problem, but simply switching to renewable energy won’t fix it. We can and must rethink everything: our energy supply, our economies and our whole world. They leave us with an inspiring vision of the future in which food, education, housing, transport and communities - in other words, all of us - work together and, with a few technological fixes, succeed in creating a world without end.



#### The Sixth Extinction
Elizabeth Kolbert

https://guardianbookshop.com/the-sixth-extinction-9781408851241/

A major book about the future of the world, blending natural history, field reporting and the history of ideas and into a powerful account of the mass extinction happening today. Over the last half a billion years, there have been five mass extinctions of life on earth. Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs.




#### Ocean - Earth's Last Wilderness
Sir David Attenborough, Colin Butfield

https://guardianbookshop.com/ocean-9781399818506/

From the icy seas of our poles to remote coral islands, David Attenborough has filmed in every ocean habitat on planet earth. Now, with long-term collaborator Colin Butfield, he shares the story of our last great wilderness - the one which shapes the land we live on, regulates our climate and creates the air we breathe. Dive into eight unique saltwater habitats, swim through kelp forests, mangroves and coral reefs and down almost 11,000 feet to the deepest corners of the most unexplored ecosystem on our planet. Experience a journey of wonder and discovery, populated by green turtles and blue whales; clownfish and bioluminescent jellyfish; the vampire squid and the 'head-less chicken monster' - a strange form of sea cucumber that lives at the very bottom of the ocean.


'THIS IS THE STORY OF OUR OCEAN AND WE MUST WRITE ITS NEXT CHAPTER TOGETHER. FOR IF WE SAVE THE SEA, WE SAVE OUR WORLD. AFTER A LIFETIME OF FILMING OUR PLANET, I'M SURE THAT NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT.' A book almost a century in the making, but one that has never been more urgently needed.


#### A Climate of Truth
Mike Berners-Lee
https://guardianbookshop.com/a-climate-of-truth-9781009440066/

We have most of the technology we need to combat the climate crisis - and most people want to see more action. But after three decades of climate COPs, we are accelerating into a polycrisis of climate, food security, biodiversity, pollution, inequality, and more. What, exactly, has been holding us back? Mike Berners-Lee looks at the challenge from new angles. He stands further back to gain perspective; he digs deeper under the surface to see the root causes; he joins up every element of the challenge; and he learns lessons from our failures of the past. He spells out why, if humanity is to thrive in the future, the most critical step is to raise standards of honesty in our politics, our media, and our businesses. Anyone asking 'what can each of us do right now to help?' will find inspiration in this practical and important book.



#### The Uninhabitable Earth: A Story of the Future
David Wallace-Wells

https://guardianbookshop.com/the-uninhabitable-earth-9780141988870/

It is worse, much worse, than you think.

The slowness of climate change is a fairy tale, perhaps as pernicious as the one that says it isn't happening at all, and if your anxiety about it is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible, even within the lifetime of a teenager today.
Over the past decades, the term "Anthropocene" has climbed into the popular imagination - a name given to the geologic era we live in now, one defined by human intervention in the life of the planet. But however sanguine you might be about the proposition that we have ravaged the natural world, which we surely have, it is another thing entirely to consider the possibility that we have only provoked it, engineering first in ignorance and then in denial a climate system that will now go to war with us for many centuries, perhaps until it destroys us. In the meantime, it will remake us, transforming every aspect of the way we live-the planet no longer nurturing a dream of abundance, but a living nightmare.


#### The Fragile Earth: Writing from the New Yorker on Climate Change

https://guardianbookshop.com/the-fragile-earth-9780008446680/

The Fragile Earth tells the story of climate change – its past, present, and future – taking readers from Greenland to the Great Plains, and into both laboratories and rain forests. It features some of the best writing on global warming from the last three decades, including Bill McKibben’s seminal essay ‘The End of Nature,’ the first piece to popularize both the science and politics of climate change for a general audience, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning work of Elizabeth Kolbert, as well as Kathryn Schulz, Dexter Filkins, Jonathan Franzen, Ian Frazier, Eric Klinenberg, and others. The result, in its range, depth, and passion, promises to bring light, and sometimes heat, to the great emergency of our age.








## Policy of sustainability: 


#### A Barrister for the Earth: Ten Cases of Hope for Our Future
Monica Feria-Tinta

https://guardianbookshop.com/a-barrister-for-the-earth-9780571386369/

Can a planet have legal rights? Could it be defended in a court of law? How do we redefine a 'right to life'? A revolution is taking place. Around the world, ordinary people are turning to courts, seeking justice for environmental wrongs. At the forefront of this movement, pioneering barrister Monica Feria-Tinta advocates not only for people, but also for those who have no voice: for rivers, forests and endangered species.


#### 'One Planet' Cities: Sustaining Humanity within Planetary Limits
David Thorpe 

https://guardianbookshop.com/one-planet-cities-9781138615106/

This book addresses the crucial question of how the essential needs of the growing human population can be met without breaking the Earth's already-stretched life-support system, and will be of great interest to practitioners and policymakers, alongside students of the built environment, urban planning, environmental policy and energy.


#### What is Environmental Politics?
Elizabeth R. DeSombre

https://guardianbookshop.com/what-is-environmental-politics-9781509534142/

What is Environmental Politics? introduces students to the different ways society attempts to deal with the political decisions needed to prevent or recover from environmental damage.  Across its six chapters leading environmental scholar Elizabeth DeSombre explains what makes environmental problems, such as climate change, overfishing or deforestation, particularly challenging to address via political processes, what types of political structures are more or less likely to prioritize protecting the environment, and how effective political intervention can improve environmental conditions and the lives of people who depend on them.


#### Ecomodernism: Technology, Politics and The Climate Crisis
Jonathan Symons

https://guardianbookshop.com/what-is-environmental-politics-9781509534142/

Is climate catastrophe inevitable? In a world of extreme inequality, rising nationalism and mounting carbon emissions, the future looks gloomy. Yet one group of environmentalists, the ‘ecomodernists’, are optimistic. They argue that technological innovation and universal human development hold the keys to an ecologically vibrant future. However, this perspective, which advocates fighting climate change with all available technologies – including nuclear power, synthetic biology and others not yet invented – is deeply controversial because it rejects the Green movement’s calls for greater harmony with nature.


#### Making Climate Policy Work
Danny Cullenward, David G. Victor

https://guardianbookshop.com/making-climate-policy-work-9781509541805/

For decades, the world’s governments have struggled to move from talk to action on climate. Many now hope that growing public concern will lead to greater policy ambition, but the most widely promoted strategy to address the climate crisis – the use of market-based programs – hasn’t been working and isn’t ready to scale. Danny Cullenward and David Victor show how the politics of creating and maintaining market-based policies render them ineffective nearly everywhere they have been applied. Reforms can help around the margins, but markets’ problems are structural and won’t disappear with increasing demand for climate solutions. Facing that reality requires relying more heavily on smart regulation and industrial policy – government-led strategies – to catalyze the transformation that markets promise, but rarely deliver.


#### Sustainable Development and Learning: framing the issues
Stephen Gough, William Scott

https://guardianbookshop.com/sustainable-development-and-learning-framing-the-issues-9780415276481/


This book examines the difficult and wide-ranging issues relating to how we understand our environment, our place in it, and how we choose to act. This comprehensive text provides an overview of these developing key issues, illustrating how - through schooling, higher education, professional training and development, and awareness-raising - people can bring about change, as well as engaging in debate and critique of issues. The book builds on existing work across a number of fields, as well as on original international research, in order to model the complexity of the problems, the institutional contexts in which they arise, and the interrelationships between these.

#### Climate Change and Clean Energy Management: Challenges and Growth Strategies
Henry Wang 

https://guardianbookshop.com/climate-change-and-clean-energy-management-9781138484887/

Climate change has never been more important than it is now, as it has become arguably the world’s most urgent problem. Solving this problem is proving difficult and complex as it involves joint efforts by governments, companies, communities and innovators. The increased use of fossil fuels associated with global economic growths has led to rising GHG emissions and global warming. There are many challenges for countries that are enacting new climate and clean energy regulations in line with their Paris Agreement commitments. Good government policies and corporate strategies are essential to support these efforts as part of the global climate change crisis. This important book addresses the latest climate change impacts and developments in potential mitigation strategies. These include fossil to clean energy transition, smart low-carbon city designs, green transportation, electric vehicles, green agriculture, carbon emission trading, carbon capture solutions plus climate finance and risk management. Potential new policies and strategies to support the successful implementation of these important strategic areas are discussed together with high-level country and business case examples.


#### Negotiating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: Origins of the Nuclear Order

https://guardianbookshop.com/negotiating-the-nuclear-non-proliferation-treaty-9781138540927/

The NPT has been signed by 190 states and was indefinitely extended in 1995, rendering it the most successful arms control treaty in history. Nevertheless, little is known about the motivations and strategic calculi of the various middle and small powers in regard to their ultimate decision to join the treaty despite its discriminatory nature. While the NPT continues to be central to current nonproliferation efforts, its underlying mechanisms remain under-researched. Based on newly declassified archival sources and using previously inaccessible evidence, the contributions in this volume examine the underlying rationales of the specific positions taken by various states during the NPT negotiations. Starting from a critical appraisal of our current knowledge of the genesis of the nonproliferation regime, contributors from diverse national and disciplinary backgrounds focus on both European and non-European states in order to enrich our understanding of how the global nuclear order came into being.










## Consumer behaviour for sustainability:

#### The Moneyless Man: A Year of Freeconomic Living

https://guardianbookshop.com/the-moneyless-man-9781786075994/

Encountering seasonal foods, solar panels, skill-swapping schemes, caravans, compost toilets, and – the unthinkable – a cash-free Christmas, Boyle puts the fun into frugality and offers some great tips for economical (and environmentally friendly) living. A testament to Mark’s astounding determination, this witty and thought-provoking book will make you reevaluate what is most precious in life.


#### Warming Up, How Climate Change is Changing Sport; Madeleine Orr

https://guardianbookshop.com/warming-up-9781399404525/

The threat climate change poses to sport is clear, but with billions of participants and fans around the world who rely on the sector for entertainment, jobs, fitness and health, this is one industry we can’t afford to lose. In this book, Madeleine Orr shows it doesn’t have to be this way. There are ways to mitigate, and perhaps counter, even the worst elements of climate change.

A world-leading sport ecologist, Madeleine interviews athletes, coaches, politicians and thought-leaders to learn more about the inevitable consequences for this trillion-dollar industry. From the frontlines of climate change, Warming Up takes readers through a play-by-play of how global warming is already impacting sport, and how the sports world can fight back.


#### Not the End of the World
Hannah Ritchie 

https://guardianbookshop.com/not-the-end-of-the-world-9781784745004/

How We Can Be the First Generation to Build a Sustainable Planet. We are bombarded by doomsday headlines that tell us the soil won't be able to support crops, fish will vanish from our oceans, that we should reconsider having children.

But in this bold, radically hopeful book, data scientist Hannah Ritchie argues that if we zoom out, a very different picture emerges. The data shows we've made so much progress on these problems, and so fast, that we could be on track to achieve true sustainability for the first time in history.

Packed with the latest research, practical guidance and enlightening graphics, this book will make you rethink almost everything you've been told about the environment, from the virtues of eating locally and living in the countryside, to the evils of overpopulation, plastic straws and palm oil. It will give you the tools to understand what works, what doesn't and what we urgently need to focus on so we can leave a sustainable planet for future generations. These problems are big. But they are solvable. We are not doomed. We can build a better future for everyone. Let's turn that opportunity into reality.


#### The surprising story of how we learned to prosper using fewer resources – and what happens next
Andrew McAfee

https://guardianbookshop.com/more-from-less-9781471180361/


This turn of events invalidates the predictions of overpopulation alarmists and those who argue we need to drastically reduce our conception of how much is enough. What has made this turnabout possible? One thing primarily: the collaboration between technology and capitalism.

Capitalism’s quest for higher profits is a quest for lower costs; materials and resources are expensive, and technological progress allows companies to use fewer of them even as they grow their markets. Modern smartphones take the place of cameras, GPS units, landline telephones, answering machines, tape recorders and alarm clocks. Precision agriculture lets farmers harvest larger crops while using less water and fertiliser. Passenger cars get lighter, which makes them cheaper to produce and more fuel-efficient. This means that, even though there’ll be more people in the future, and they’ll be wealthier and consume more, they’ll do so while using fewer natural resources. For the first time ever, and for all time to come, humans will live more prosperous lives while treading more lightly on the Earth.


#### The Self-sufficiency Bible: 100s of Ways to Live More Sustainably – Wherever You Are
Simon Dawson 

https://guardianbookshop.com/the-self-sufficiency-bible-9781786784834/

Self-sufficiency is a means of taking control of our lives and safeguarding for the future – and this new, fully updated edition of the sustainability classic will help every householder do just that. You’ll find all the practical information and expert guidance you need on every aspect of self-sufficiency, from gardening and baking through health, beauty and cleaning to foraging and livestock, whatever your needs, circumstances and resources. 


#### The Story of Stuff: How Our Obsession with Stuff is Trashing the Planet, Our Communities, and Our Health - and a Vision for Change

https://guardianbookshop.com/the-story-of-stuff-9781849010382/

Annie Leonard, creator of the internet film sensation 'The Story of Stuff', viewed over 6 million times, offers an astonishing, galvanizing book that tells the story of all the 'stuff' we use every day - where our bottled water, mobile phones and jeans come from, how they're made and distributed, and where they really go when we throw them away. Our out-of-control consumption habits are killing the planet and threatening our health, but Annie provides hope that change is within reach. Like An Inconvenient Truth and Silent Spring, The Story of Stuff will be an instant classic.



#### Awakenings: a guide to living a vegan lifestyle
Lucy Watson

https://guardianbookshop.com/awakenings-9780751580600/

A truly vegan lifestyle is more than just the food you eat, it's the shoes on your feet, the clothes in your wardrobe, the contents of your cupboards and your make-up bag. Whether vegan for moral, ethical or environmental reasons Lucy Watson demystifies how to live a holistic vegan life, whether it's something you've been practising for years or is a way of life you're just discovering. Simple, practical and full of beautiful images Awakenings is perfect for anyone looking to reduce their environmental impact and make ethical choices that don't impact on animals.


#### Man's War Against Nature
Rachel Carson

https://guardianbookshop.com/mans-war-against-nature-9780241514450/

With the precision of a scientist and the simplicity of a fable, Rachel Carson reveals how man-made pesticides have destroyed wildlife, creating a world of polluted streams and silent songbirds. Over the past 75 years, a new canon has emerged. As life on Earth has become irrevocably altered by humans, visionary thinkers around the world have raised their voices to defend the planet, and affirm our place at the heart of its restoration. Their words have endured through the decades, becoming the classics of a movement. Together, these books show the richness of environmental thought, and point the way to a fairer, saner, greener world.


#### F**k Plastic: 101 ways to free yourself from plastic and save the world
The F Team

#### Spend Green and Save The World: Tackling Climate Change Through The Consumer-Led Movement
Liz Christou

https://guardianbookshop.com/spend-green-and-save-the-world-9781838099039/

Climate change is the most important issue facing the world today. But are you left wondering what more you can do, personally? This book is a practical guide on what you can do to make a difference. And the amazing thing is that it only takes 3.5% of a population to act in order to create cultural change, and a mindshift in wider thinking! By coming together and using our consumer power – as part of The Consumer-Led Movement – we can influence businesses and government policy, and rapidly shape a better future. All through consciously choosing how we spend our money.

Making changes can be challenging even when we have the best of intentions. Instead of massive, overnight changes – incremental change is the key. By applying principles from psychology and problem-solving techniques, this book shows readers how to embark on a motivational journey of actualising climate change solutions. These provide the means to live in line with environmental values, and improve overall wellbeing.















## Energy transition

#### The Hydrogen Economy: The Creation of the Worldwide Energy Web and the Redistribution of Power on Earth
Jeremy Rifkin

https://guardianbookshop.com/the-hydrogen-economy-9780745630427/

While the fossil fuel era is entering its sunset years, a new energy regime is being born that has the potential to remake civilization. Hydrogen is the most basic and ubiquitous element in the universe. It is the stuff of the stars and of our sun and, when properly harnessed, it is the “forever fuel.” It never runs out and produces no harmful CO2 emissions. Commercial fuel-cells powered by hydrogen are just now being introduced into the market for home, office and industrial use. The major automakers have spent more than two billion dollars developing hydrogen cars, buses, and trucks, and the first mass-produced vehicles are expected to be on the road in just a few years.

In the new era, says Rifkin, every human being could become the producer as well as the consumer of his or her own energy – so called “distributed generation.” When millions of end-users connect their fuel-cells into local, regional, and national hydrogen energy webs (HEWs), using the same design principles and smart technologies that made possible the World Wide Web, they can begin to share energy – peer-to-peer – creating a new decentralized form of energy use.

Hydrogen has the potential to end the world’s reliance on imported oil and help diffuse the dangerous geopolitical game being played out between Muslim militants and Western nations. It will dramatically cut down on carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate the effects of global warming. And because hydrogen is so plentiful and exists everywhere on earth, every human being could be “empowered,” making it the first truly democratic energy regime in history.


#### The Energy Evolution: Harnessing Free Energy From Nature
Viktor Schauberger

https://guardianbookshop.com/the-energy-evolution-9781858600611/

Nature produces energy by slow, cool, implosive means - by a centripeta inward motion, while our presnt culture uses explosive centrifugal (outwards) movement, which is wasteful and many times less powerful and effective. It aslo uses up the Earth's resources and pollutes her ecosystems.

This volume describes different kinds of energy machines which depend on the principle of implosion:
- a spring water-producing machine
- a tornado home energy generator
- a Klimator which produces mountain-quality air
- the biotechnical submarine
- a technique for producing power from ocean deeps


#### Visions of Energy Futures: Imagining and Innovating Low-Carbon Transitions
Benjamin K. Sovacool 

https://guardianbookshop.com/visions-of-energy-futures-9780367112004/

This book seeks to examine the visions, fantasies, expectations, and rhetoric associated with six state-of-the-art energy systems—shale gas, clean coal, nuclear power, hydrogen fuel cells, smart meters, and electric vehicles—playing a key role in current deliberations about low-carbon energy supply and use. 

#### Renewable Energy for the Arctic
New Perspectives

https://guardianbookshop.com/renewable-energy-for-the-arctic-9780367511739/


This book explores various facets of the transition to renewable energy in the Arctic region. It critically examines the adverse effects of fossil fuel extraction and use, environmental and social impacts of climate change, and the possibility of a low carbon energy system through innovation and technology. Drawing together a diverse range of contributors and considering a range of new energy sources, this volume also looks at the scale of the transition challenges in the Arctic energy production and use, the necessary flexibility to balance energy demand and supply, the need of a more integrated energy infrastructure, and the new energy business models, health and safety, and quality standards for the region. Finally, it examines the transit and influence between Arctic and non-Arctic countries, in terms of growth, partnerships and new dynamics of a transitioning process to a sustainable energy system.


#### Energy and Development
Frauke Urban

https://guardianbookshop.com/energy-and-development-9781138485969/

In the field of energy and development, the world faces two major challenges: (1) Providing energy access to the roughly one billion people worldwide who do not have access to electricity and the nearly three billion people worldwide who do not have access to clean cooking fuels; (2) achieving socioeconomic development while limiting global atmospheric temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius to mitigate climate change. Taking stock of progress, Frauke Urban explores the key issues surrounding these goals and addresses the policy responses aimed at ending energy poverty and achieving sustainable development. She outlines various options for delivering energy access, analyses past and prospective energy transitions and examines the social, environmental, economic and technological implications of these possibilities. Taking a holistic and multi-disciplinary approach and containing useful teaching resources, Energy and Development provides a comprehensive overview of this complex field of study.


#### The Oil Crisis
Fiona Venn

https://guardianbookshop.com/the-oil-crisis-9780582308091/


 In October 1973 two crises – one economic, one political – intersected, with dramatic and long term consequences for international relations. On 6 October, Egypt and Syria launched an attack on Israel, and within a few days the major Arab oil producers announced their support by use of the ‘oil weapon’, including a boycott of supplies for countries friendly to Israel and a programme of production cuts. This was followed by the unilateral declaration of a steep increase in the price of oil by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The result was international panic and world recession. Crude oil prices soared by a massive fourfold in just three months. The West's vulnerability had been exposed: it was being held hostage to oil. Yet, despite efforts to address this dependence on oil imports in following years, the 1979 Iranian Revolution triggered a further upward surge in prices. Today, the importance of oil remains at the forefront of the West's foreign policy calculations in the Middle East. In this fascinating and timely new look at the oil crisis, Fiona Venn examines these issues and the more unexpected effects of the crisis. She asks just how much really changed in the economic balance of power. Most importantly she argues that OPEC was used as a scapegoat for the world recession, which had been already underway when the crisis detonated.   






## Economic growth

#### Slow Down or Die
Timothee Parrique

https://guardianbookshop.com/slow-down-or-die-9781805227090/

One of the most deeply ingrained beliefs of our age is that perpetual economic growth is the solution to most, if not all, of society's problems. In Slow Down or Die, French economist Timothée Parrique brilliantly challenges this myth, demonstrating how producing more won't solve climate change, poverty, or inequality. In fact, our obsession with growth is accelerating social and ecological collapse.Parrique proposes a different vision - a "post-growth" economy, where we look beyond the vagaries of GDP and measure our economies through how well we provide for each other. Instead of infinitely accumulating wealth, our goal must be a just, equitable, and sustainable society. Accessible and inspiring, Slow Down or Die is a radical call to embrace a future of shared prosperity, where slowing down is the key to a better, sustainable future.

#### Prosperity without Growth: Foundations for the Economy of Tomorrow
Tim Jackson

https://guardianbookshop.com/prosperity-without-growth-9781138935419/


The publication of Prosperity without Growth was a landmark in the sustainability debate. Tim Jackson’s piercing challenge to conventional economics openly questioned the most highly prized goal of politicians and economists alike: the continued pursuit of exponential economic growth. Its findings provoked controversy, inspired debate and led to a new wave of research building on its arguments and conclusions. Jackson demonstrates that building a ‘post-growth’ economy is a precise, definable and meaningful task. Starting from clear first principles, he sets out the dimensions of that task: the nature of enterprise; the quality of our working lives; the structure of investment; and the role of the money supply. He shows how the economy of tomorrow may be transformed in ways that protect employment, facilitate social investment, reduce inequality and deliver both ecological and financial stability.


#### The Spirit of Green: The Economics of Collisions and Contagions in a Crowded World

https://guardianbookshop.com/the-spirit-of-green-9780691214344/

Solving the world’s biggest problems—from climate catastrophe and pandemics to wildfires and corporate malfeasance—requires, more than anything else, coming up with new ways to manage the powerful interactions that surround us. For carbon emissions and other environmental damage, this means ensuring that those responsible pay their full costs rather than continuing to pass them along to others, including future generations. In The Spirit of Green, Nobel Prize–winning economist William Nordhaus describes a new way of green thinking that would help us overcome our biggest challenges without sacrificing economic prosperity, in large part by accounting for the spillover costs of economic collision.


### Welcome to the Circular Economy: The next step in sustainable living
Claire Potter

https://guardianbookshop.com/welcome-to-the-circular-economy-9781913947125/

Looking to live a life that goes beyond 'sustainability'? Welcome to the circular economy. But what it is exactly? Taking inspiration from nature, the circular economy is a series of interconnecting systems that make everyday life more sustainable. Plus, we can all be part of it: you, your second cousin, that guy that lives down the street and the person you follow on Instagram on the other side of the world.

#### Sustainable Economics: Context, Challenges and Opportunities for the 21st-Century
Keith Skene, Alan Murray 

https://guardianbookshop.com/sustainable-economics-9781783531516/

This book marks a milestone in Economics publishing. Sustainable Economics is *the* subject of the moment, as businesses across the globe face up to peak oil prices, climate instability, increasingly complex environmental legislation and the challenge of adapting to a new business landscape. Sustainable Economics: Context, Challenges and Opportunities for the 21st Century Practitioner debugs the language of sustainable development. It explores the strengths and weaknesses of the many and diverse schools of thought. The book enables the modern business student and practitioner to disentangle the complex, often convoluted debate relating to sustainability, and it provides the tools necessary to lead their organizations through the murky waters of current times and prepare for the challenges of the future. Eschewing the linear – take, make and waste – approach of current business and manufacturing thinking, this book revisits the ecological models underpinning recent economic sustainability theory, and re-examines the consequences of modern ecological thought upon business  strategies relating to sustainability. A chapter is also dedicated to the "circular economy", already in common parlance at policy levels in the UK, and notably in China and other developing countries.

## Raw materials:

#### Nature's Evil: A Cultural History of Natural Resources
Alexander Etkind (King's College, Cambridge) 

https://guardianbookshop.com/natures-evil-9781509547586/

This bold and wide-ranging book views the history of humankind through the prism of natural resources – how we acquire them, use them, value them, trade them, exploit them. History needs a cast of characters and in this story the leading actors are peat and hemp, grain and iron, fur and oil, each with its own tale to tell. 

The uneven spread of available resources was the prime mover for trade, which in turn led to the accumulation of wealth, the growth of inequality and the proliferation of evil. Different sorts of raw material have different political implications and give rise to different social institutions. When a country switches its reliance from one commodity to another, this often leads to wars and revolutions. But none of these crises go to waste – they all lead to dramatic changes in the relations between matter, labour and the state. Our world is the result of a fragile pact between people and nature.


#### Resource Recovery from Municipal Sewage Plants: An Energy-Water-Nutrients Nexus for Developing Countries

https://guardianbookshop.com/resource-recovery-from-municipal-sewage-plants-9781138584006/

Water, energy, and food are basic requirements for life, and this book presents solutions for obtaining these from sewage wastewater treatment plants. It describes the optimal recovery of value-added products from municipal sewage plants in developing countries, and explains how the plants’ operations can become both economical and sustainable. Further, it shows how the clean effluent that is obtained is then suitable for agricultural use in the production of bio-fertilizers, and graywater for irrigation, and how the recovered biogas could be used for energy and heating needs. Practical case studies from three separate sewage plants are presented to illustrate the processes involved.

#### Green Wedge Urbanism

https://guardianbookshop.com/green-wedge-urbanism-9781350154346/

Part history, and part contemporary argument, this book first examines the emergence and global diffusion of the green wedge in town planning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, placing it in the broader historic context of debates and ideas for urban planning with nature, before going on to explore its use in contemporary urban practice. Examining their relation to green infrastructures, landscape ecology and landscape urbanism and their potential for sustainable cities, it highlights the continued relevance of a historic idea in an era of rapid climate change.

#### Livable Cities from a Global Perspective

https://guardianbookshop.com/livable-cities-from-a-global-perspective-9781138696754/

The case studies investigate livability issues in such cities as Austin, Texas; Helsinki, Finland; London, United Kingdom; Warsaw, Poland; Tehran, Iran; Salt Lake City, United States; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Sydney, Australia; and Cape Town, South Africa. The chapters are organized into such themes as livability in capital city regions, livability and growth and development, livability and equity concerns, livability and metrics, and creating livability. Each chapter provides unique insights into how a specific area has responded to calls for livable cities. In doing so, the book adds to the existing literature in the field of livable cities and provides policy makers and other organizations with information and alternative strategies that have been developed and implemented in an effort to become a livable city.

#### Housing Sustainability in Low Carbon Cities
Ralph Horne

https://guardianbookshop.com/housing-sustainability-in-low-carbon-cities-9781138698345/


Housing affordability, urban development and climate change responses are great challenges that are intertwined, yet the conceptual and policy links between them remain under-developed. Housing Sustainability in Low Carbon Cities addresses this gap by developing an interdisciplinary approach to urban decarbonisation, drawing upon more established, yet quite distinctive, fields of built environment policy and design, housing, and studies of social and economic change. Through this approach, policy and practices of housing affordability, equity, energy efficiency, resilience and renewables are critiqued and alternatives are presented. Drawing upon international case studies, this book provides a unique contribution to interdisciplinary urban and housing studies, discourses and practices in an era of climate change.

#### Green Infrastructure: Incorporating Plants and Enhancing Biodiversity in Buildings and Urban Environments
John W. Dover

https://guardianbookshop.com/green-infrastructure-9780415521246/

With more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas, it is vitally important that towns and cities are healthy places to live. The principal aim of this book is to synthesize the disparate literature on the use of vegetation in the built environment and its multifunctional benefits to humans. The author reviews issues such as: contact with wildlife and its immediate and long-term effects on psychological and physical wellbeing; the role of vegetation in removing health-damaging pollutants from the air; green roofs and green walls, which provide insulation, reduce energy use and decrease the carbon footprint of buildings; and structural vegetation such as street trees, providing shading and air circulation whilst also helping to stop flash-floods through surface drainage. Examples are used throughout to illustrate the practical use of vegetation to improve the urban environment and deliver ecosystem services.


## Carbon capture technology

#### Carbon Capture
Howard J. Herzog, MIT Press

https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262535755/carbon-capture/

A concise overview of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), a promising but overlooked climate change mitigation pathway.

The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO2), and these CO2 emissions are a major driver of climate change. Carbon capture offers a path to climate change mitigation that has received relatively little attention. In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, Howard Herzog offers a concise guide to carbon capture, covering basic information as well as the larger context of climate technology and policy. Carbon capture, or carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), refers to a suite of technologies that reduce CO2 emissions by “capturing” CO2 before it is released into the atmosphere and then transporting it to where it will be stored or used. It is the only climate change mitigation technique that deals directly with fossil fuels rather than providing alternatives to them.

#### Zero-Carbon Industry: Transformative Technologies and Policies to Achieve Sustainable Prosperity
Jeffrey Rissman

https://guardianbookshop.com/zero-carbon-industry-9780231204200/

This book delivers a first-of-its-kind roadmap for the zero-carbon industrial transition, spotlighting the breakthrough innovations transforming the manufacturing sector and the policies that can accelerate this global shift. Jeffrey Rissman illustrates the scope of the challenge, diving into the workings of heavy polluters like steel, chemicals, plastics, cement, and concrete. He examines ways to affordably decarbonize manufacturing, such as electrifying industrial processes, using hydrogen, deploying carbon capture and storage, and growing material efficiency with lightweighting and 3D printing. But technologies are only part of the picture. Enacting the right policies—including financial incentives, research and development support, well-designed carbon pricing, efficiency and emissions standards, and green public procurement—can spur investment and hasten emissions reductions. Rissman provides a framework to ensure that the transition to clean industry enhances equity, health, and prosperity for communities worldwide.

#### Burn: Igniting a New Carbon Drawdown Economy to End the Climate Crisis
Albert Bates, Kathleen Draper

https://guardianbookshop.com/burn-9781603589840/

How We Can Harness Carbon to Help Solve the Climate Crisis? In order to rescue ourselves from climate catastrophe, we need to radically alter how humans live on Earth. We have to go from spending carbon to banking it. We have to put back the trees, wetlands, and corals. We have to regrow the soil and turn back the desert. We have to save whales, wombats, and wolves. We have to reverse the flow of greenhouse gases and send them in exactly the opposite direction: down, not up. We have to flip the carbon cycle and run it backwards. For such a revolutionary transformation we’ll need civilization 2.0.

#### Emerging Carbon Capture Technologies

Making these cities healthy, vibrant and sustainable is an exceptional challenge which this book addresses. It sets out some of the basic principles of the design of our future cities and, through a series of carefully-selected case studies from leading designers’ experience, illustrates how these ideas can be put into practice.



#### Public Places Urban Spaces: The Dimensions of Urban Design
Matthew Carmona 

https://guardianbookshop.com/public-places-urban-spaces-9781138067783/

Public Places Urban Spaces provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, theory and practices of urban design for those new to the subject and for those requiring a clear and systematic guide. In this new edition the book has been extensively revised and restructured. Carmona advances the idea of urban design as a continuous process of shaping places, fashioned in turn by shifting global, local and power contexts. At the heart of the book are eight key dimensions of urban design theory and practice—temporal, perceptual, morphological, visual, social, functional—and two new process dimensions—design governance and place production.


#### Designing London’s Public Spaces: Post-war and Now

https://guardianbookshop.com/designing-londons-public-spaces-9781848222588/

In ‘super-diverse’ cities like London, a successful public realm, where people can be together in trust and tolerance, is essential. A city’s commitment to design quality indicates a commitment to civic health. In the interests of such commitment, the book asks: What should public space ‘design intentions’ be today?; Who is ‘the public’ of public spaces?; What can/should designers do to protect the ‘publicness’ of public spaces?; Was state financed public space mid-20th century of any higher quality than privately financed public space today?; How significant is the shift from commissioning architects to design public spaces mid-20th century to commissioning landscape architects and public realm architects today?; Does emptiness in public spaces have a value?; Does retail in public spaces narrow the range of people visiting them?



#### Elements of Visual Design in the Landscape
Simon Bell

https://guardianbookshop.com/elements-of-visual-design-in-the-landscape-9780367024475/

#### Ecologies Design
Transforming Architecture, Landscape, and Urbanism

https://guardianbookshop.com/ecologies-design-9780367491055/

The notion of ecology has become central to contemporary design discourse. This reflects contemporary concerns for our planet and a new understanding of the primary entanglement of the human species with the rest of the world.

The use of the term ‘ecology’ with design tends to refer to how to integrate ecologies into design and cities and be understood in a biologically-scientific and technical sense. In practice, this scientific-technical knowledge tends to be only loosely employed. The notion of ecology is also often used metaphorically in relation to the social use of space and cities. This book argues that what it calls the ‘biological’ and ‘social’ senses of ecology are both important and require distinctly different types of knowledge and practice. It proposes that science needs to be taken much more seriously in ‘biological ecologies’, and that ‘social ecologies’ can now be understood non-metaphorically as assemblages. Furthermore, this book argues that design practice itself can be understood much more rigorously, productively and relevantly if understood ecologically. The plural term ‘ecologies design’ refers to these three types of ecological design. This book is unique in bringing these three perspectives on ecological design together in one place. 


#### Sustainable by Design: Explorations in Theory and Practice

https://guardianbookshop.com/sustainable-by-design-9781844073535/

To advance the subject of design one has to engage in the activity of designing. Sustainable by Design offers a compelling and innovative, design-centred approach that explores both the meaning and practice of sustainable design. Walker explores the design process in the context of sustainability, and challenges conventional ways of defining, designing and producing functional objects. He discusses the personal design process, tacit knowledge, ephemeral design, experimental design, and the relationship between intellectual design criteria, physical expression and aesthetic experience.

https://www.amazon.com/Empire-AI-Dreams-Nightmares-Altmans-ebook/dp/B0DQSQKMY4

"The book’s title, Empire of AI, is no metaphor; Hao argues persuasively that OpenAI and its peers operate like modern colonial empires, extracting vast resources—compute power, data, labor, energy, and water—while leaving environmental and human tolls in their wake. In her new book, Empire of AI, Karen Hao insists that AI companies don’t have to choose between exploiting workers and chasing growth."



## Sustainable/green software

##### Developing Sustainable and Energy-Efficient Software Systems
Artem Kruglov , Giancarlo Succi

https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-11658-2

This book provides information how to choose and collect the appropriate metrics for a software project in an organization. There are several kinds of metrics, based on the analysis of source code and developed for different programming paradigms such as structured programming and object-oriented programming (OOP). This way, the book follows three main objectives: (i) to identify existing and easily-collectible measures, if possible in the early phases of software development, for predicting and modeling both the traditional attributes of software systems and attributes specifically related to their efficient use of resources, and to create new metrics for such purposes; (ii) to describe ways to collect these measures during the entire lifecycle of a system, using minimally-invasive monitoring of design-time processes, and consolidate them into conceptual frameworks able to support model building by using a variety of approaches, including statistics, data mining and computational intelligence; and (iii) to present models and tools to support design time evolution of systems based on design-time measures and to empirically validate the
